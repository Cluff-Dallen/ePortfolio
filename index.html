        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Currently I'm a student finishing up my software engineering degree at BYU-I. I'm expected to graduate in less than a year. While I work towards graduation, I am currently searching for an intership. I'll be avalible to start as soon as my current
            semester ends in mid July.</p>

        <p>I'm excited to learn, improve, and grow my skills and knowledge as I begin my career as a young software engineer. I work well with others, and would consider myself a great commuicator and an excellent addition to any team. I can lead, and teach
            those around me or even follow when neccesary. </p>

        <hr style="color: #FFFFFF;" width="50%">

        <h2>Skills and Knowledge</h2>
        <p>I'm fluent in C++, having used it throughout most of my education as I worked towards my degree. I'd also consider fluent and well rounded using html, css, and javascript. I'm comfortable and more than familiar with Linux, as that I've been using
            it for several years now. I'm also knowlegable of using Github, and even familiar with some use of git in the commandline. I have breifly worked with SQL, JSON, AJAX, and PHP althought I wouldn't consider myself fluent in them, more so just
            a basic undertanding.</p>
